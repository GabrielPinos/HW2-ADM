# Steam Reviews 2021 Analysis

This project explores the "Steam Reviews 2021" dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najzeko/steam-reviews-2021). The goal is to answer a series of research questions using exploratory, statistical, and visualization-based analysis.

## Project Description

The dataset includes user reviews of various Steam applications, containing detailed information about reviews, user behavior, and application features. We conducted a thorough analysis to gain meaningful insights into user patterns and behaviors.

## Research Questions and Approach

### RQ1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- *Objective*: Understand the structure and key characteristics of the dataset.
- *Approach*: Tabular summaries, distribution visualizations, and descriptive metrics.

### RQ2: Review Distribution Across Applications
- *Objective*: Identify which applications have the highest and lowest number of reviews.
- *Visualizations*: Plot of reviews per application in descending order.
- *Insights*: Percentage breakdown of reviews for the top 5 titles, comparing purchased and free reviews.

### RQ3: Temporal Analysis of Reviews
- *Objective*: Identify periods when users are most active in submitting reviews.
- *Visualizations*: Monthly and seasonal review trends, time-of-day distribution.
- *Analysis*: Function to analyze review counts across specified time intervals.

### RQ4: Relationship Between Playtime and Ratings
- *Objective*: Analyze if users who spend more time on an application give higher or lower ratings.
- *Statistical Analysis*: Distribution of ratings based on user experience and significance testing.

### RQ5: Analysis of Top Reviewers
- *Objective*: Examine the top 10 reviewers in terms of review count, language usage, and review quality.
- *Visualizations*: Distribution of reviews and analysis of helpful votes received by these top reviewers.

### RQ6: Behavior of English vs. Spanish Reviewers
- *Objective*: Compare the habits of English and Spanish reviewers.
- *Analysis*: Frequency of review updates and comparison of average games owned by reviewers.

### RQ7: Probabilities and Statistical Testing
- *Objective*: Calculate the probability of receiving helpful votes and test statistical independence between variables.
- *Hypotheses*: Validate or refute hypotheses using statistical analysis.

### Bonus: Sentiment Analysis of Review Texts
- *Objective*: Classify review sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) for the top 3 languages.
- *Approach*: Compare sentiment analysis with recommendation status and analyze trends with helpfulness votes.


### Algorithmic Question AQ
- Given integers $n$ and $k$, determine if  $n$ can be expressed as the sum of  $k$ positive integers with the same parity (all even or all odd), and output "YES" with the sequence or "NO" if not.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- *Python Libraries*: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, nltk
- *Machine Learning Tools*: Sentiment analysis models
- *LLM Tools*: Used for interpretation and validation of results
